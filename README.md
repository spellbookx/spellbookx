# 🪄 What is spellbookx?

`spellbookx` is your enchanted source-of-truth for creating reproducible, multi-scope development environments — empowering developers to weave together machines, shells, editors, tools, and projects with elegant automation and clarity.

## 🔮 Purpose

- Declare your entire developer ecosystem as code — versioned, validated, and repeatable.
- Orchestrate configuration across layers: machine, system, user, and project.
- Enable seamless, scalable developer setups that just work — everywhere.
- Provide an intuitive, CLI-powered experience with `sbx` (coming soon).
